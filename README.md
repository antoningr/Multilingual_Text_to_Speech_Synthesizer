# üó£Ô∏è Multilingual Text-to-Speech Synthesizer

This is a **`Streamlit` web application** that converts text into **natural-sounding speech** in **multiple languages** using `Google Text-to-Speech` (`gTTS`). The app supports **language auto-detection**, **speech speed control**, and *audio format selection** (MP3 or WAV). Users can enter or paste text, select a language or auto-detect it, and generate audio that can be played back or downloaded.
